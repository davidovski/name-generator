# Name Generator

This is the source code of the recurrent neural network name generator that I created for my NEA project. The idea behind the project was to generate unique looking names from an existing dataset of real names, with various categories for different genders and countries. 

This repository features two parts:
- Python name generator, including the Recurrent Neural Network
- Java webserver which hosts the javascript web app

Unfortunately I have decided to not include the report that I wrote on this project to avoid any issues with collusion, however generally I have tried my best to document and explain the code itself.
